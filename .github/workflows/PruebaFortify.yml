        version: 21.1.2                                      # On-prem customers should specify a client version that matches their ScanCentral environment
                                                             # FoD customers usually should not specify a version but rather rely on the default version
        client-auth-token: ""                                # Optional, but required if ScanCentral Controller requires client authentication

    ### Run Fortify ScanCentral Client ###
    # Update BUILD_OPTS based on the ScanCentral Client documentation and your project's included tech stack(s).
    #   ScanCentral Client will download dependencies for maven, gradle and msbuild projects.
    #   For other build tools, add your build commands to the workflow to download necessary dependencies and prepare according to Fortify SCA documentation.
